"""Device-family profiles and capability discovery for Aiper devices.

Profiles answer three separate questions:

- Which Home Assistant surfaces should this device expose?
- How should raw device-reported numeric mode IDs be labelled?
- What do this firmware's `Machine.status` codes actually mean?

Do not treat every reported `Machine.mode` ID as a commandable cleaning mode.
Surfer devices report mode as read-only cleaning context, while Scuba exposes
known selectable cleaning modes. Shark/unknown devices only expose a cleaning
mode select when the cloud explicitly reports supported mode IDs.
