## Recent Changes

### v1.3.5
- Rebased the community reliability build onto the maintainer's merged S1
  capability implementation and preserved the validated MQTT, lifecycle,
  charging, clean-path, and estimated-runtime corrections.

### v1.2.4
- Fixed Scuba S3 reporting charging as "Returning" and full charge as "Charging", which left the charging sensor inverted. Status codes are now interpreted per model; other models are unchanged.

### v1.2.3
- Fixed HACS release notes layout bug by combining custom release notes with GitHub format.

### v1.2.2
- Fixed HACS release notes display timing issue by ensuring the GitHub Release is fully built before clients poll the new tag.

### v1.2.1
- Fixed empty release notes in HACS UI by dynamically injecting CHANGELOG.md snippets into GitHub Release tags.

### v1.2.0
- Removed "Experimental" tags from documentation. All supported models (Surfer S2, Shark, etc.) are now marked as "Verified".
