> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Development has moved upstream.** The changes developed in this fork through
> `v1.7.0` have been merged into
> [kmich/ha-aiper](https://github.com/kmich/ha-aiper) and are included in its
> `v1.7.0` release. New installations, updates, and support requests should use
> the upstream repository. This fork remains available for historical releases
> and may be reused for focused future development, but it is not the current
> distribution source.

**Bring your Aiper pool cleaner and water quality monitor into Home Assistant.**  
View live status, battery, charging state, cleaning modes, consumables, and water chemistry (pH, ORP, Chlorine) alongside safe controls, directly in your smart home dashboard.

> [!WARNING]
> **Unofficial & Cloud-Based**
> This integration uses Aiper's cloud services (REST and AWS IoT MQTT). It is unofficial and not affiliated with Aiper. Because it relies on reverse-engineered cloud APIs, an update to the Aiper app or firmware could break functionality. Please read the [Security & Privacy Guide](docs/trust/security-privacy.md) before installing.

## 📊 Features & Entities

The integration uses "capability profiles" to automatically expose only the features your device supports.

- **Pool Cleaners:** Live state, battery, cleaning mode controls, clean path preferences, Surfer S2 start/stop, and filter/brush consumable tracking.
- **Water Quality Monitors:** Live pH, ORP (mV), EC (µS/cm), TDS (ppm), Free Chlorine (mg/L), overall Water Quality Score, and bitmask-decoded alarm warnings.
- **Device Actions:** Safe buttons to force-refresh cloud metadata or re-sync the MQTT shadow state.

*(Note: Diagnostic telemetry like raw voltages, currents, and lifetime cleaning hours are hidden by default to keep your dashboard clean. You can enable them manually in the entity registry.)*
